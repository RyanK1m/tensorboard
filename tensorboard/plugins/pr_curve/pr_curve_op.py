  """Computes multi-class PR summaries for a list of thresholds in `[0, 1]`.

  Computes true/false positive/negative values for the given `predictions`
  against the ground truth `labels`, against a list of evenly distributed
  threshold values in `[0, 1]` of length `num_thresholds`.

  Each number in `predictions`, a float in `[0, 1]`, is compared with its
  corresponding label in `labels`, and counts as a single tp/fp/tn/fn value at
  each threshold. This is then multiplied with `weights` which can be used to
  reweight certain values, or more commonly used for masking values.

  This method supports multi-class classification, and when `num_classes > 1`,
  the last dimension of `labels` and `predictions` is the class dimension.

  Like most `tf.metrics` methods, this returns a pair `(metrics, update_op)`
  where `update_op` should be used at each `session.run()` to update `metrics`,
  and `metrics` should be evaluated at the end.

  NOTE(chizeng): This is basically a faster implementation of simliar methods in
  `tf.contrib.metrics.streaming_XXX_at_thresholds`, where we assume the
  threshold values are evenly distributed and thereby can implement a `O(n+m)`
  algorithm instead of `O(n*m)` in both time and space, where `n` is the
  size of `labels` and `m` is the number of thresholds.

  Args:
    tag: A tag attached to the summary. Used by TensorBoard for organization.
    labels: The ground truth values, a `Tensor` whose dimensions must match
        `predictions`. Should be of type `bool`.
    predictions: A floating point `Tensor` whose values are in the range
        `[0, 1]`. Shape is arbitrary if `num_classes=1`; otherwise, the
        last dimension should be exactly `num_classes`.
    num_thresholds: Number of thresholds, evenly distributed in `[0, 1]`, to
        compute PR metrics for. Should be `>= 2`.
    weights: Optional; If provided, a `Tensor` that has the same dtype as,
        and broadcastable to, `predictions`.
    num_classes: Optional; Used when `predictions` is a multi-class classifier.
    display_name: The name displayed atop this PR curve in TensorBoard.

  Returns:
      A tensor summary used by the pr_curve plugin.
